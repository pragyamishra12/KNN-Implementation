# KNN-Implementation
K-Nearest Neighbours is considered to be one of the most intuitive machine learning algorithms since it is simple to understand and explain. Additionally, it is quite convenient to demonstrate how everything goes visually. However, the kNN algorithm is still a common and very useful algorithm to use for a large variety of classification problems. If you are new to machine learning, make sure you test yourself on an understanding of both of this simple yet wonderful algorithm.

It is important to note that there is a large variety of options to choose as a metric; however, I want to use Euclidean Distance as an example. It is the most common metric used to calculate distances among vectors since it is straightforward and easy to explain.
